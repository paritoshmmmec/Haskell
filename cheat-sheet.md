List  operation: 
1) `head` takes a list and returns its head. The head of a list is basically its first element.
2) `tail`  takes a list and returns its tail. In other words, it chops off a list's head.
3) `last` takes a list and returns its last element.
4) `init` takes a list and returns everything except its last element.
5) `head` []  will throw an error
6) `length` takes a list and returns its length, obviously.
7) `reverse` reverses a list.
8) `take` takes number and a list. It extracts that many elements from the beginning of the list.
9) `drop` works in a similar way, only it drops the number of elements from the beginning of a list.
10) `maximum` takes a list of stuff that can be put in some kind of order and returns the biggest element.
11) `minimum` returns the smallest.
12) `product` takes a list of numbers and returns their product.
13) `elem` takes a thing and a list of things and tells us if that thing is an element of the list. It's usually called as an infix function because it's easier to read that way.
